## Hi Everyone 👋

I'm Eeymoo(`/ˈiːmuː/`).

I like Markdown and JavaScript.

I can develop TS \ JS \ CSS \ Vue \ React. I can use Python, so I only know a little bit. But we can look up Python documentation anywhere.

The editor I have been using for the longest time is vscode, and I have also been learning vim recently.
